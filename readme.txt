SUMMARY:
  
* Give your users an easy way to help IT support staff by providing them with the easiest IP Address lookup tool.
* Simple system tray application that performs an IP address lookup for all LAN connections

DESCRIPTION:

IP Address Informer is a simple system tray application that performs an IP address lookup for all LAN connections. IP Address Informer will show the current IP address of the users machine so that they can let IT support staff know the IP Address to connect to remotely through Remote Desktop or VNC. No more talking users through using ipconfig or navigating network properties to lookup IP address!
You can also use this tool to check IP address assigned to your computer and to find your IP address.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Visual Studio 2010 or later to compile
* Windows XP (or newer) with .Net Framework to run

INSTRUCTIONS:

* Using IP Address Informer is as easy as asking your users to place their mouse cursor over the thunderbolt icon on the bottom right hand side of the screen next to the clock! It will then popup a tooltip stating their local IP address on the internal LAN.
* To compile the executable, open IPInformer.sln in Visual Studio and build the project.
